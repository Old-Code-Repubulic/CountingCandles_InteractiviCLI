# CountingCandles_InteractiviCLI
Decided to have a little fun with the Counting Candles problem I recently did. In this repoe, Ive created a CLI app which askes the user their age, finds out how many 
signel digets are in their age, and will repong back a series of facts about the age. A simple example sould be that someone puts their age at 18 and the app repsonds
“there are 2 instance of 9 that makes up 18.” then maybe a very long case statement for  0-125 which gives a random fact about something that happened 
in your birth year. Im pretty certain there is an API for this somewhere, but this app will probably need to generate a date, or initially ask the user for their bithday
in an mm/dd/yyyy format. That way if can just use that value in the API call as a parameter, then the app will get a response based on the day entered!
